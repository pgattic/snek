# Snek

Just a fun little snake game :)

This for me is an experiment in cross-platform programming, in the C language. I picked up C not so long ago, and I am really excited to get better at it! So this is a chance for me to broaden my knowledge and overall familiarity with compiling and using build systems. 

As of now, it only compiles for Nintento DS, using libnds and gl2d. But, I hope to soon be able to run it on a wide variety of systems, with more features and more fun graphics!

## Building

### For Nintento DS:
 - Have devkitARM, along with libnds and gl2d, installed ([instructions](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started))
 - clone the repo and `cd` to its directory
 - `make`
